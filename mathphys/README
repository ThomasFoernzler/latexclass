     The MathPhys LaTeX Classes (mathphys-article/letter)
==================================================================================

You shold have recieved at least the following files to be
able to use the mathphys-article and mathphys-letter class:
     mathphys-article.dtx
     mathphys-letter.dtx
     imp-letter.dtx
     MathPhysLogo.pdf
     MathPhysLogoInfo.pdf
     MathPhysLogoMathe.pdf
     MathPhysLogoMathInf.pdf
     MathPhysLogoPhysik.pdf
     MathPhysLogoIMP.pdf
     and this README

To get the .cls files and pdf documentation simply run twice

  pdflatex mathphys-article.dtx
  pdflatex mathphys-letter.dtx
  pdflatex imp-letter.dtx

The derived .cls file as well as files MathPhysLogo*.pdf
should be moved to a place where TeX can find them. Either 
save them somewhere in your TeX-PATH or in the directory where
the documents will be stored.

Mac-Users: simply move all the files to
/Users/putYourUsernameHere/Library/texmf/tex/latex/putYourDirectoryNameHere
and then run >>sudo texhash<<. This works at least with Texlive2017.
You may have to install some stuff, which you will be prompted to do on the
console, in order to run texhash. If this doesn't work, you can try and find
out where your $TEXMFHOME (your texpath file on mac) variable is pointing by
running >>tlmgr config<< and looking for it in the output on the console.
